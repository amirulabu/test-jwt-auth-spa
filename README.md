# JWT Auth SPA with HTTP-only cookies

## About

- this repo is an example on how to implement JWT stateless sessions on the server side using Nestjs and client side using React
## Problem

- storing session credentials (jwt, random hash, etc) in local storage and non-http-only cookies is BAD

## Solution

- Access token and refresh token as per OAuth 2.0, but both not sent directly to client. 
  - access token is sent from server via json, will be stored in client side javascript, meaning its a variable but no open to global
  - refresh token is sent to client in form of http-only cookie and it is automatically sent with every request (or only refresh endpoint)
  - the access token is refreshed when the token is expired or a page load happens by sending a POST request to `/refresh`
